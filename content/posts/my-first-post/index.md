Hello friends, I'm hopping on the hot new post-Cohost trend of making a personal webpage and hope you'll join me for the ride! 

Possibly we haven't met yet - I'm Stu! I'm a computer guy in Minnesota and have a bunch of interests I plan to post about:
- Bikes and bikepacking
- DIY projects and gardening
- Painting miniatures
- Games of all sorts
- Computers / programming stuff I've learned

In general I'm thinking of using this is a project log and journal, but who knows what'll happen.

Lately, my "big thing" has been bikepacking - bike-based camping trips. They tend to take a fair amount of planning and I at least think that process is pretty interesting and might be worth sharing.

I'm also hoping to use this site to keep in touch with people I've met around the internet. I don't have comments set up yet but I'd love to hear from you - you can find my other socials as well as email linked up at the top of the page. Honestly, it'd be a real treat to get an email. This site also supports RSS so you should be able to subscribe for updates (let me know if this doesn't work).

Thanks for checking out my site, I hope I'll see you around!
