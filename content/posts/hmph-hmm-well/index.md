Cohost is going away and I'm pretty bummed about it! I suppose the only thing to do is to march forward bravely into this new future of blogging on my own dang website.

As I've mentioned, I think this is going to be a projects blog and today I started a new project: resurfacing the deck. I was originally going to take a week off to ride bikes but with this sprained ankle I think that's asking a bit much of myself, so instead: deck. My first steps today were clearing it off, removing the lattice trim, and giving it a good cleaning with deck cleaner.

As pictured, this deck is not in great shape (but the boards all feel solid). I'm planning to use a 'deck resurfacer' product to basically just put a thick coat over everything and fill in all the gaps. I've seen mixed reviews but as you can see there's not a huge amount of life left in the deck so I think I'm willing to roll the dice - my dad really liked it.

Next steps: a few parts are still sealed based on beading when I was splashing cleaner around. I'll go through and give them a good sanding. The rest I can apparently just paint right over, so I will. I have a dr appointment in the middle of the day to look at my ankle but if all goes well, tomorrow I will have finished the sanding, primed and painted the rails. If I have time I'll get started on the floor but it's fine if it takes an extra day.
