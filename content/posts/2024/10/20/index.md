Old:

With lattice removed, after first round of sanding:

New:

Well it took far more effort than expected but I'm putting a pin in the deck project for this year. The decking is painted, the frame is sanded (whew, it took hours) and stained (took minutes) and I think it looks reasonably nice for now. Obvious the railing is falling to pieces and painted all over but I'm just going to replace the whole thing in the spring so I didn't worry about it this season.

Sanding took forever, wow. I suspect I could have gotten away with a lower grit on my little orbital sander but whatever. For the most part the square lattice shadows are gone and the stain seems to have absorbed in fine so that's the main thing.

Now I'm starting to feel very ready to hibernate, it's been a very full year. I think the last thing I really need to do is get my bike into the shop. Named my blog after bikes and then haven't actually been riding much!
