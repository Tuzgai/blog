We finished the painting! Two coats of 'deck resurfacing paint' and it looks a little less messed up and is hopefully protected a bit better. Obviously with the level of damage there's only so much I want to invest but I think it's an improvement. I think a third coat could potential fill in some of those small cracks even more but whatever.

Next steps for the next week or so:
- finish sanding the joists the lattice attaches to
- stain them
- acquire, cut and attach lattice

Waiting for spring:
- Remove and replace balustrade

btw, I reorganized my content organization a bit, hoping that doesn't blast your RSS reader but if it does I'm sorry. Shouldn't need to change again.
