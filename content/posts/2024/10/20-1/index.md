Now that the weather's cooling off, I'm getting ready to run a [Triangle Agency](https://www.hauntedtable.games/) virtual campaign and getting EXTREMELY PUMPED about it. 

Highlights for me the GM (general manager):
- Incredibly cool 'playwall' system where large amounts of the game on up, legacy-style, through play. As the GM I read through most of it to be prepared and it's wild getting emotional reading a rulebook.
- Emphasis on player interaction - each character has a number of relationships. I would call them NPCs but they're played by the other people at the table. So cool!
- Monster of the week style loop feels like it's going to make mission design a snap
- Tonally there's a fun mix of comedy and horror

I might write up our sessions here, along with big warnins because there WILL be spoilers, for a tabletop rpg. It's weird!

We're doing session 0 next week and I'm really going as hard as I can on the businesscore theme:
- I'll be on webcam wearing a button up and tie
- I have [slides set up for the introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gP7pqSP8c5r1fdV0XOCCmPpp2zT5oA9CuCjO4Mih1uY/edit?usp=sharing)
- There's a miro board where we'll be doing character creation / lines and veils / etc
- I included an agenda with the invite

I'm also using [Kenku FM](https://www.kenku.fm/) to run music on Discord and have a little soundboard set up with a variety of pleasing noises for commendations and a loud buzzer for demerits.

Hopefully the group likes it, I think this game is going to be a lot of fun.
