Borrowing from [videodante](https://blog.dante.cool/) (though I think it's a fairly common blog thing) I think I'm going to start doing roundups of things I want to share, and Fridays seem like a good day for it.

### Reading

#### Laura Michet - [Biking Catalina Island](https://blog.lauramichet.com/biking-catalina-island/)

A nice writeup about a bike trip to Catalina Island, I appreciated the mix of bike adventures and exploration of how this weird, rich little society operates.

#### videodante - [You Should Read Umineko](https://blog.dante.cool/you-should-read-umineko/)

Convinced me I should read Umineko this winter.

#### videodante (lol 2 links) - [Link Roundup 6: a collection of cohost memoriams ](https://blog.dante.cool/link-roundup-6-a-collection-of-cohost-memoriams/)

I have also been thinking a lot about Cohost and only a few days later am already missing it badly. videodante linked to a bunch of posts I also thought were worth reading so I'm just going to steal his work.

#### hikari - [the algorithm is killing twitter and it's driving me insane](https://hikari.noyu.me/blog/2024-10-02-the-algorithm-is-killing-twitter-and-its-driving-me-insane.html)

I think this post pulls together a lot of the problems with modern social really well. Specifically, the move from concrete social networks, governed by network effects, to diffuse algorithms governed by engagement signals. There's been a weird feedback loop where companies train their users to expect a faucet of content and then users sort of forget there are people on the other side of the posts. 

I've also just been surprised to learn how many people depend on algorithmic timelines of some sort, one of the big appeals to Cohost for me was that I could just get a chronological timeline of people I follow. Even the other day I asked on Mastodon for good follows and someone who follows 17 people replied saying I should just follow hashtags. Guy, this was your chance to boost another human being you respect!

#### Iain M. Banks - [Look To Windward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_to_Windward)

Something I appreciate about the Culture books is that they're both about fully automated luxury gay space communism and also not a wholehearted endorsement of everything the Culture does. The core of this book is the fallout of a Big Mistake and a lot of thinking about what utopia means, what it means to try to spread utopia, and the consequences of failure to do so.

### Music
Tom Caruana - [Strange Planet](https://tomcaruana-teasea.bandcamp.com/album/strange-planet)
> This sci-fi hip-hop epic is my 'working outdoors' music of choice. I really enjoy the general sound but have been having a good time piecing together the underlying story as well.

### Games
I had this week off and spent most of it stressing about the deck, but I also picked up Unicorn Overlord and man, it's a good one. I am really enjoying the autobattler Ogre Battle style gameplay and also seeing 13 Sentinels deep in its bones. The story is very tropey but it keeps things rolling and I love the art/voice acting/music. 1000xResist remains my game of the year but I'm having a great time with this one.

### Also!

[Zumphry](https://zumphry.net/) made me this extremely cool 88x31 button ![animated gif of a bike pulling an stu systems logo into frame, the word systems blinks a few times and then loops](stu-systems-8831.gif). I gotta find somewhere to put it on this website!
