After burning a day sanding the balustrade I had a lot of time to think about how crappy it is, the spindles just feel wet and rotted to the touch and sanding them I'm scared they'll just vibrate apart. It's all warped and ugly and I don't think a new coat of paint will save it. So, instead I think I'm just going to chop it off. I'm checking with the city if I need a permit, but otherwise I have power washed the actual decking and now just need to give it a couple days to dry. I think Saturday will be painting day.
