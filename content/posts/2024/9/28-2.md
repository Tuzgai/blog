If you were curious, currently this site is made using the static site generator Hugo with their beginner template Ananke, hosted on github pages. Probably I will change every part of this at some point but I wanted to get something online before our dear eggbug goes to bed.

Features I want to add:
- [Add support for h-entry](https://cohost.org/nex3/post/7851202-use-h-entry-to-make)
- Add comments using a self-hosted platform
- Better understand hugo's post organization
- More interesting styling

But hey, it's a start! I have a week off so I'll have some time to tinker.
