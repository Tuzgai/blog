Hello internet, it's been a while! I obviously haven't been blogging much lately. And honestly, after cohost and the election, I just haven't been online as much. I'm more or less free of social media, which has been nice for my brain.

Anyway, I thought it might be nice to give a little life update and talk about my big project.

### The new project

This year is the year I've decided to lose weight, basically because I weighed about 300lbs and was getting frustrated running into restrictions on maximum weight/size for things - bikes, camping chairs, clothes etc. Also, I'm starting to set my sights on bigger bikepacking rides, and hauling 300lbs plus a bike, gear, food and water up a mountain feels daunting. 

So! I started counting calories and using a food scale and it's honestly been surprising how straight forward the process has been. I'm already very active so dropping into a deficit hasn't really ended up with me being particularly hungry, mostly I just eat fewer sugary snacks. Even outside of weight loss, I feel like tracking calories/protein/fiber has been helpful for understanding what I'm eating, it feels like getting the manual that my body wasn't packaged with. I think about food a lot less now that I have a plan that I don't need to think particularly hard about.

Aside from that, I'm lifting weights and building some sorely needed upper body strength. It turns out lifting weights has also been revelatory in how simple it is. Less than an hour a day a couple times a week and I'm getting stronger. I know I'm getting stronger because I keep lifting heavier weights. It's honestly a lot more straightforward that working out your biking strength - FTP tests are hell.

So that's the big thing! I'm down 35 pounds so far this year with no signs of slowing down. Aside from the obvious things like "being a bit smaller" I'm finding unexpected benefits all over the place. Breathing is easier, I'm more flexible in noticable ways, my camping sleep mat doesn't bottom out anymore. Pretty cool stuff!

Anyway, that's all I'm really going to say about that because I know it's kind of a boring topic to anyone who's not going through it. But if you've ever considered whether you want to lose weight or get stronger I'll say: turns out it's possible, and everyone's different but it may be more straightforward than you think.

Also, if you're at all interested in getting stronger check out [Casey Johnston's blog/books](https://www.shesabeast.co/beginner-start-here/).

### The next big adventure!

I'm doing the MS 150 again in June, but right after that my dad and one of my brothers are going to bike a portion of the Lake Superior Circle Tour from Ironwood MI to Grand Marais MN. After that I'm out of time off so I'll bike back to Duluth to get a ride home and they'll continue on back to Michigan via ferry. Little jealous I can't do the whole trip, but such is the life of a working stiff.

Including the MS 150, it'll be ~550 miles over 8 days, pretty good I think! I'm sure I'll be back with photos and notes on gear and such after. Next weekend when I get my bike back from the shop I'll do a gear shakedown and make sure everything fits nicely.

### Hope you're well well

A lot of what's going on in the world really sucks! I hope that between whatever you're thinking or doing about that, that you also find some time for joy in your life. I've been checked out of internet for a while, but I'll try to rummage through the rss reader and see what's going on / say hello.

Alright, let's see if I remembered how this blog works...
